# Here We Go
Hello everyone,
this will be my first blog post. Here I will describe what the goal of my blog is and what you will find on here!

First up, my blog is WIP, I will make changes on the website and try stuff out on the software end of things.
So it could be that my blog doesn't work or that you encounter some errors on the website itself.
Feel free to message me, or open an issue on GitHub if you encounter an error or have improvement tips.


## Topics
But what will I be talking about in this Blog?
I will be publishing things I learned along the way creating and maintaining the blog and try to present my knowledge in the best way possible! So regarding the blog the theme will mostly be software and writing.

But these are not the only topics I plan to discuss, another big one will be finances or stuff regarding finances!
Finances play a big role in everyone's live, so I find it important to have them under control and organized.
But having them under control and organized is not enough, you need to help your mony grow!

The last topic and maybe the reason I started this blog is self-improvement.
I want to document my journey and write about the stuff I learned to improve myself.
The Blog will also help me, so I can be kept accountable.

**To summarize, the topics will be:**
    - software
    - writing
    - finances
    - self-improvement

## The Goal
At last I want to tell you what my goal is, what I aspire to get from the blog.
The goal is to help me better myself, with this blog I want to earn new knowledge of myself and my surroundings.
If you read this far, welcome to my journey!
